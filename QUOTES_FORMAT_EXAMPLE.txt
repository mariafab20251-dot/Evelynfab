SEPARATE SUBTITLE & VOICEOVER FILES - NEW FEATURE GUIDE
===============================================================================

NEW FEATURE: You can now have different text for subtitles and voiceover
              using TWO SEPARATE FILES!

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Quotes.txt → Contains subtitle text (what viewers SEE)
   - Short, punchy, main heading
   - Displayed as captions in center
   - Shown in static text overlay at top

2. VoiceoverText.txt → Contains voiceover narration (what viewers HEAR)
   - Full explanations with context
   - Spoken by TTS voiceover
   - Can be much longer

3. Line matching:
   - Line 1 in Quotes.txt pairs with Line 1 in VoiceoverText.txt
   - Line 2 in Quotes.txt pairs with Line 2 in VoiceoverText.txt
   - And so on...

===============================================================================
EXAMPLE SETUP:
===============================================================================

FILE: Quotes.txt
----------------
Success is not final
Hard work beats talent
Dream big 🚀
Never give up
Your mindset matters

FILE: VoiceoverText.txt
-----------------------
Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. Remember, every successful person has faced failures along the way. The difference is they didn't give up. They kept pushing forward, learning from their mistakes, and eventually achieved their dreams. You can do the same!

Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. You might not be the most gifted person in the room, but consistent effort and dedication will take you further than raw talent alone. Make it a habit to work hard every single day, and you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish.

Dream big, work hard, stay focused, and surround yourself with good people. Your dreams are valid, no matter how impossible they might seem right now. Break them down into smaller goals, take action every day, and never lose sight of your vision. Success is a journey, not a destination.

Never give up on your dreams. When things get tough, when people doubt you, when obstacles seem insurmountable - that's exactly when you need to push harder. Champions are made in moments when quitting seems like the only option. Keep going, keep fighting, keep believing in yourself.

Your mindset is everything. The way you think determines the way you live. Cultivate positive thoughts, surround yourself with uplifting people, and choose to see opportunities instead of obstacles. With the right mindset, there's nothing you can't achieve.
